First things first, We whould add the EntityFramework Components as packages

Microsoft.EntityFramework Core
Microsoft.EntityFramework Design // project wouldnt add any migration if this is missing // it may give an error that the PL has no this package,, then add...
Microsoft.EntityFramework SqlServer
Microsoft.EntityFramework Tools

---------------------------------------------------------

Then the connection strings into the Context class should be created to SQL 

ALl entities we want to use in our Dataserver as tables should be added
to the Context Class as prop

example

public DbSet<Sample> Samples {get; set;}

And then we apply migrations via package manager console 
but the migrations are significantly should be applied to the DAL
migrations helps CODEFIRST

add-migration mig_add_sample
update-database


---------------------------------------------------------
GENERIC REPO 

CRUD 
Create, Read, Update, Delete

A metod will be implemented for each operations of crud
will sign into the abstract
and therefore we will be able to fill them up into the Concrete
